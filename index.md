## Projects

Masqt is made up of several projects.

* [`masqt-web-frontend`](https://github.com/masqt/masqt-web-frontend) is our web front-end, primarily built with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org).

* [`masqt-web-backend`](https://github.com/masqt/masqt-web-backend) is our API server, primarily built with [Django REST Framework](https://django-rest-framework.org) on top of [Django](https://djangoproject.com).

* [`aws-lambda-ses-pgsql-aliases`](https://github.com/masqt/aws-lambda-ses-pgsql-aliases) (to be renamed very soon) is the AWS Lambda function that communicates with the API to handle email forwarding from Masques to inboxes.
